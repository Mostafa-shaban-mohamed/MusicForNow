# MusicForNow
<h3>Website for Listening and Downloading Music</h3>
<p>
In this project, I created website which help the users to listen to their favourite tracks and download it.
On other hand the admins can control the website without knowing any programming language.
The admins can upload songs, add artists and albums & manage the website easily with siple friendly framework.
The project accepts any file type for audio(mp3, WAV) and images(PNG, JPNG) and store it in database which is designed for this project.

<h4>The Database</h4>
<p>
The database was created to help in storing important informations and data such as user info and songs files. For the user, the important data collected from user such as password
 was hashed and hashed code was stored in database to secure the info, and the same goes for admin too. For other files (song file & images...),
 the data was stored in database as varbinary (array of bytes).
